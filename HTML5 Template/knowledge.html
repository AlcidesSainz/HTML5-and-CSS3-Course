									<h2>Java</h2>
									<p>Number of jobs: 29,000 <br>

										Average annual salary: $104,000 <br>
										Benefits: Java is the programming language most commonly associated with the development of client-server applications, which are used by large businesses around the world. Java is designed to be a loosely coupled programming language, meaning that an application written in Java can run on any platform that supports Java. As a result, Java is described as the “write once, run anywhere” programming language.
										Drawbacks: Java is not ideal for applications that run on the cloud, as opposed to the server (which is common for business applications). In addition, the software company Oracle, which owns Java, charges a licensing fee to use the Java Development Kit.
										Common uses: Along with business applications, Java is used extensively in the Android mobile operating system.</p>

									<h2>C++</h2>
									<p>
										Number of jobs: 9,000 <br>
										Average annual salary: $97,000 <br>
										Benefits: C++ is an extension of C that works well for programming the systems that run applications, as opposed to the applications themselves. C++ also works well for multi-device and multi-platform systems. Over time, programmers have written a large set of libraries and compilers for C++. Being able to use these utilities effectively is just as important to understanding a programming language as writing code, Gorton says.
										Drawbacks: Like C, C++ has complex syntax and an abundance of features that can make it complicated for new programmers. C++ also does not support run-time checking, which is a method of detecting errors or defects while software is running. 
										Common uses: C++ has many uses and is the language behind everything from computer games to mathematical simulations.

									<h2>Python</h2>
									<p>
										Number of jobs: 19,000	<br>
										Average annual salary: $120,000	<br>
										Benefits: Python is widely regarded as a programming language that’s easy to learn, due to its simple syntax, a large library of standards and toolkits, and integration with other popular programming languages such as C and C++. In fact, it’s the first language that students learn in the Align program, Gorton says. “You can cover a lot of computer science concepts quickly, and it’s relatively easy to build on.” It is a popular programming language, especially among startups, and therefore Python skills are in high demand.
										Drawbacks: Python is not suitable for mobile application development.
										Common uses: Python is used in a wide variety of applications, including artificial intelligence, financial services, and data science. Social media sites such as Instagram and Pinterest are also built on Python.
